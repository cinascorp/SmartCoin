Proof of Knowledge (PoK)

 It is a method in cryptography and information security, by using which a person can prove his knowledge about a piece of information to others, without revealing a part of this knowledge.

 One use of PoK in cryptography is to prove that a person has a particular cryptographic key without revealing the key itself.  In other words, by using PoK, a person can prove to others that he has knowledge without revealing any part of that knowledge.

 PoK is used in authentication and encryption protocols and is used in many fields such as information security, finance, privacy, etc.

 To create a new mechanism using proof of knowledge, we need two things:

 1- A proof-of-knowledge protocol that has already been designed for a specific problem and a new problem from which we want to build a proof-of-knowledge.

 First, we need to find a proof-of-knowledge protocol for a given problem.

 2- We must choose the new problem for which we want to create proof of knowledge in such a way that you can prove our knowledge about this problem using the existing proof of knowledge protocol.

 For example, suppose you want to create a two-way signature mechanism that can be used for interactions between two people.  In other words, you want both people to be able to sign a document independently, without the help of a third party.

 For this, you can use the proof-of-knowledge protocol, and by using it, two people can prove their knowledge of the agreement on the content of the document to the other, instead of signing the document.  In this way, you can create a two-way signature mechanism that can be used for interaction between two people, without the help of a third party.

 Completeness is a property of an interactive proof system that guarantees that if a true proof knows the witness, the verifier will always accept the proof.  This means that when the prover has evidence for the statements they are trying to prove, the verifier will always be convinced of the truth of that statement.

 2: credit:

 Validity is a feature of an interactive proof system that ensures that if a prover succeeds in convincing a verifier, their probability of success cannot be greater than the probability of a knowledge miner (a type of adversary) in extracting a witness.  From the prover's side, possibly malicious.  In other words, if the prover can successfully convince the confirmer, 
 they must have knowledge of the witness that confirms their claim.

 Together, completeness and validity ensure that an interactive proof system is a safe and reliable way to prove a proposition, even when an honest prover and a malicious prover compete to convince the verifier.
 
 Discrete logarithm:

 L={x\mid g^{w}=x} .....

 L:

 It is a collection of all disciplines that have a special condition.  Here, the set L contains all strings that can be written as powers of the generator g

 That is, g to the power of w is equal to x.

 --------------------------

 x:

 A member of the set L which can be any number.

 --------------------------

 g:

 A generator in a cyclic group is usually selected in a special way.

 --------------------------

 w:

 It is a proof that shows that the relationship between x and g defined in the set L holds.  In other words, they seek to find and calculate the value of this witness.

 --------------------------

 mid: 
 
 Here, "mid" is used as a proxy for conditions that are not necessarily relevant to the particular data of this example.

 In the following, we refer to 2 types of protocols:


 1 Schnorr protocol group order protocol

 2 Sigma protocols

 Schnorr protocol:

 The excerpt describes a protocol for proving the knowledge of a witness in a group setting.  This protocol consists of a prover and a verifier.  The prover wants to convince the verifier that he knows the witness in a language, and the verifier wants to confirm the prover's claim without directly exposing the witness.  This protocol satisfies the completeness and correctness conditions as well as the zero knowledge property.

 In this protocol, the L language is not explicitly defined.

 Instead, we

 * a group with generator g,

 * Order q

 * and we have two random values r and x.

 ** prover (P),

 ** The witness knows w = r + cx,

 So that :

 g^w = ty^c mod q

 

 where t,y,c are general values

 And y is another group generator.

 To prove knowledge, the prover goes through an interactive process with the verifier V.

 The verifier checks whether:

 g^s = ty^c mod q.

 This protocol ensures that the prover knows the witness w without revealing it to the verifier.

 Sigma protocols:

 Protocols that structure three movements above

 (commitment, challenge and response) are called sigma protocols.

 The Greek letter represents the flow of the protocol.  Sigma protocols exist for proving various expressions, such as those involving discrete logarithms.  Using these proofs, the prover can not only prove the knowledge of the discrete logarithm, but also prove that the discrete logarithm has a special form.

 The excerpt describes a special type of proof known as the Sigma protocol, which follows a three-move structure of commit, challenge, and reply.  Sigma protocols are used to prove various expressions, including those involving discrete logarithms.

 PK{(x):y_{1}=g_{1}^{{x}}\land y_{2}={(g_{2}^{a})}^{{x}}g_{2}  ^{b}}

 The notation PK (public key) specifies what knowledge the prover is proving, which in this case is the discrete logarithm of y1 with respect to base g1, and another related discrete logarithm of y2 with respect to base g2.

 The purpose of the Sigma protocol is for the prover to convince the verifier that he knows x that satisfies the given equations without revealing the value of x.  The protocol is performed in three steps:

 Commitment: The prover chooses a random number and calculates the commitment to this number using the public key.  This commitment is then sent to the approver.

 Challenge: The verifier generates a random challenge and sends it to the open prover.

 Answer: The prover responds to the challenge with a message that demonstrates knowledge of solving the given equations.

 By repeating these three steps a few times, the verifier can be convinced that it knows the prover x that satisfies the given equations, but the prover does not reveal the value of x itself.  The security of the Sigma protocol depends on this
 
 Sigma protocol in simpler terms:

 The excerpt we provided explains the concept of sigma protocols, which are commonly used in cryptography to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the secret itself.  Here is a more detailed explanation of the mathematics behind the Sigma protocols:

 First, let's talk about the discrete logarithm problem.

 In a group, if: g^x = y, x

 is the discrete logarithm of y with respect to the base g.  The difficulty of computing discrete logarithms is the basis of many cryptographic systems.

 The Sigma protocol is a family of phased three-way protocols

 

 * obligation

 * Challenge

 * Response

 In cryptography, a prover wants to convince a verifier that he knows a secret.

 The verifier wants to make sure that the prover knows the secret, without learning anything else about the secret.

 **Format of a Sigma protocol:

 - Pledge: The prover sends a pledge of their secret to the verifier.

 - Challenge: The verifier sends a random challenge to the prover.

 - Answer: The prover answers the challenge in such a way as to show

 Knowing the Secret In the excerpt we presented, this protocol involves proving the knowledge of the discrete logarithm of y1 with respect to base g1 and another related discrete logarithm of y2 with respect to base g2.

 A formal statement that defines what this protocol proves:

 PK\{(x):y_{1}=g_{1}^{{x}}\land y_{2}={(g_{2}^{a})}^{{x}}g_{2  }^{b}\}

 This proof notation defines the knowledge that the prover knows an x such that:
 
 y1 = g1^x and y2 = (g2^a)^x * g2^b.

 To prove this knowledge, the prover commits to a random value r and calculates the commitments related to this value according to the relevant bases.

 These commitments are then sent to the approver.  The verifier then generates a random value c and sends it to the prover as a challenge.  The prover computes an answer that satisfies the verifier's challenge and sends it to the verifier.

 Prover repeats this process for a fixed number of rounds and if the answers in each round

 is fixed, the verifier accepts the proof.  The key mathematical property that ensures the security of this protocol is the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem.

 If the prover can prove knowledge of the discrete logarithm without revealing the value of x itself, then they know the secret.

 Sigma protocols achieve this by exploiting mathematical properties of the underlying group, along with randomization and zero-knowledge proofs.

 In summary, sigma protocols are a powerful tool in modern cryptography that enable efficient and secure proof of knowledge without exposing sensitive information.

 This article is an abstract in Persian of the famous Pinocchio article that IBM and Microsoft presented in 2013 to prove zero knowledge with discrete logarithms!

 * The translation was really difficult and it took me almost a month **

 So far, it was an introduction to how zero knowledge and discrete logarithm functions work!

 Now, from now on, we have a small, very difficult discussion, and then we will enter into programming:

 ------------------------------------------

  Linear algebra

 ------------------------------------------

 Discrete logarithm functions in linear algebra and caused the machine to need several cores to solve equations.

 which is very effective in the speed of functions such as the number of transactions per second,

 This issue can be seen in blockchain and decentralized applications in terms of network power and performance, and it has an important impact!

 In order to create a mechanism to such an extent that we can analyze the information correctly, he put the idea of proof of knowledge in my mind because of the power that existed in the consensus of the cores in the blockchain...

 Decentralized artificial intelligence network that only accepts correct values

 And with correct and scientific propositions, it rewards users who present a correct scientific article with a unique currency, as we said, the value of this currency is in the science and knowledge that correctly produced this token.  Not only with function and mathematics (pow), not by investing in the network (pos) but by adding knowledge to the network!  (PoK)

 Our goal is to establish balance in the financial system with the nobles of science to eliminate issues such as rent-seeking and money laundering!

 A small explanation about linear algebra and how machines and artificial intelligence can think like humans in parallel.

 (Although the parallel thinking of artificial intelligence is still in the field of evolution)
 
 # data-driven knowledge proof

 This approach, based on deducible and reliable data analysis, allows you to be confident that the privacy of sensitive data is preserved and that systems are functioning properly.

 All in all, rest assured that artificial intelligence as a witness, with proper programming, can contribute to the stability, trust and security of the system for cryptocurrency generation.  This performance improvement can be easily demonstrated to system users by issuing data-driven proofs of knowledge.

 GPT 3.5 Turbo & GPT-4

 Autoregressive model

 The famous GPT4 model or self-correlated model

  Important and practical

 ------------------------------------------

 Those interested in artificial intelligence and how the functions work will be used in the discussion of decentralized artificial intelligence in the future!

 ------------------------------------------

 Correlated functions: Autoregressive model

 Random and Gaussian differentials

 (Gaussian noise)

 This expression refers to the autocorrelation model and is defined as follows:

 Xt = c + ∑ i=1 p φi Xt-i + εt

 In this statement, variable X is equal to the value obtained at time t and is autocorrelated based on its past values.

 The model parameters, denoted by φ, include the number p that is used from X to estimate the value of t.

 The constant number c is either used for simplicity.  εt is also a white Gaussian value.

 In fact, AR p model is defined as a linear combination of Xt-i variables and φi parameter values for i=1 to p.
 
 In fact, the AR p model is a combination

 A line of variables Xt-i and parameter values φi is defined for i=1 to p.

 This autocorrelation model is used in time series analysis due to the dependence and direct effect of the past values on the new value.

 For the AR(p) model, in order to ensure its survival, some restrictions are applied on its parameters.

 For example, the non-zero root of a polynomial

 z^p-∑i=1p φi z^p-i

 It is important.

 In order to properly value the parameters φi, the roots of the polynomial must be inside the unit circle, in other words, we must have the option that all the roots of z have a modulus less than 1.

 It is easy to say that the AR(p) model means an autocorrelation model of order p, which is used to determine the value of the variable Xt at time t, from the past values of Xt-i (i from 1 to p) along with the parameters φi and the white noise.  εt is used.

 In the end, by checking the bounds defined for the parameters φi and checking the location of polynomial roots, it can be ensured that the AR(p) model is valid and can be properly used in time series analysis.

 In general, the autocorrelation model of order p includes a number of parameters that depend on the previous value of p and also includes the value of Gaussian coefficient (εt).

 This model can be used as a basis for forecasting and analyzing time series, and restrictions are applied on its parameters to ensure the validity and accuracy of the model in a longer time.

 ----------------------------------------
 
 I will give an example so that these topics are better and more concrete

 Based on the concepts and tools of Chapters 1 and 2.

 Sina goes to the mountains in the summers and lives behind the mountain.

 He found that water boils at a temperature lower than 100 degrees Celsius

 He thought it was a valid scientific article!

 If he wants to register this article, how can he get a reward from this method in the blockchain?

 and earn?

 We will consider an example of boiling water at high altitudes.

 Especially at an altitude of 3000 meters, where the boiling point of water is lower than sea level.

 Example:

 1 - Proving Boiling Water at High Altitude Imagine that Sina has boiled water at an altitude of 3000 meters and wants to prove this fact to the administrator without revealing additional information about the temperature, exact altitude or any other private information.  The manager wants to check that the water was actually boiled and that the process was done correctly.

 2-Functions and math

 We will use the same zero-knowledge proof principles as in Chapter 1, including completeness, validity, and the use of a Turing machine.  We will also use the logarithm function introduced in Chapter 1 to ensure that the proof can only be produced with certain private knowledge.

 Sina performs the following steps to prove that water boils at high altitudes

 He picks a random number, let's call it "r", and calculates a value called "t" by raising "g" to the power of "r" (t = g^r) by a constant.

 Cina then measures the temperature of boiling water (let's call it "T") and calculates another value called "w" by subtracting the boiling point of water at sea level (100°C) from the boiling point of water at altitude.  he does.  of 3000 m and then multiply by a constant "c" (w = c*(100 - boiling point at 3000 m)).

 Then, Sina calculates another value called "x" by raising the constant "g" to the power of "w".

 (x = g^w).

 Sina calculates a final value called "y" by multiplying "t" and "x" together (y = t*x).

 Finally, Cena sends "y" to Marie to prove that she did indeed boil water at 3,000 meters.

 To verify Sina's proof, Marie follows these steps:

 Marie calculates another value for "w" by taking the temperature of boiling water and determining the boiling point at 3000 m using the same formula that Sina used earlier.

 Marie then calculates the value of "x" by raising the constant "g" to the power of "w" (x = g^w).

 Later, Marie calculates "t" using the "y" value sent by Cena and the "x" value she just calculated (t = y/x).

 Finally, using the logarithmic function from Chapter 1, Marie verifies that "t" is indeed equal to g^r.

 If "t" is equal to g^r, this means that Sina's argument is valid and Marie can be convinced that Sina really boiled water at 3000 m.

 We can further explore the concept of proof of zero knowledge by examining other applications and use cases.
 
 We can also look at more complex mathematical functions and protocols that can be used in these proofs, including advanced cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation.

 The use of zero-knowledge proofs for digital identity verification, online authentication, and secure communications can also be explored in depth.

 For example, using zero-knowledge proofs can address privacy concerns when verifying digital identity or performing age verification without revealing a user's true age.

 Overall, there are several exciting applications and areas to explore in the world of zero-knowledge proofs, and we can continue to build on the foundations we established in Chapters 1 and 2 to develop more advanced and secure protocols.
 
 Let's finish Chapter 3 by focusing on how to implement zero knowledge proof in a smart contract.  In particular, we define a new digital currency called "Smartcoin" using solidity and show how zero-knowledge proof can be applied to secure transactions on the blockchain.

 #SmartCoin

 Smart currency:

 1- User interface and welding point article for

 To begin, we need to define the user interface for the smart coin and explain how the boiling point article will be used in the smart contract.

 The user interface allows users to transfer smart coins from one wallet to another and view their account balance.

 The boiling point article will be used as private information to prove zero knowledge, allowing transaction parties to prove their identity without revealing additional information.

 2- Connecting to the smart contract We need to create a connection to the smart contract so that users can interact with smart coins.

 The connection can be made using

 web3.js

  A JavaScript library that enables interaction with a blockchain node via an RPC interface.

 It allows users to view their account balances, transfer smart coins and interact with the zero-knowledge proof protocol.

 3- Zero Knowledge Proof Protocol In the next step, we implement the zero knowledge proof protocol to ensure secure transactions in the blockchain. 
 
 This protocol uses the boiling point article as private information to allow transacting parties to prove their identity to each other without revealing additional information.  To achieve this goal, we will use the zk-SNARKs (Non-Interactive Short Argument of Knowledge with Zero Knowledge) protocol.  
 
 This ensures the privacy of the transaction parties and makes the SmartCoin network much larger
 
 -------------------------------------------
 
 pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.9.0;

contract Smartcoin {
    mapping (address => uint256) public balanceOf;

    string boilingPoint = "";  // Store the boiling point article here

    function transfer(address to, uint256 value, uint256[2] memory proof) public {
        require(balanceOf[msg.sender] >= value, "Not enough balance");

        // Check zero-knowledge proof
        bool verified = verifyProof(msg.sender, to, value, proof);

        require(verified == true, "Invalid proof");

        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= value;
        balanceOf[to] += value;
    }

    function verifyProof(address from, address to, uint256 value, uint256[2] memory proof) private view returns (bool) {
        // Return true if proof is valid, false otherwise
        // Use zero-knowledge proof based on boilingPoint
    } 
}
